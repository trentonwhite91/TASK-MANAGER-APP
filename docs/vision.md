# Introduction
This project aims to build a distributed task management platform that allows small teams to create, assign, and track tasks in real-time. Unlike existing tools, the focus is on lightweight collaboration, ease of use, and intelligent task recommendations powered by machine learning.

# Problem Statement
Small distributed teams often struggle with:

- Overly complex project management tools
- Limited intelligent insights into workload balancing

Our project addresses these gaps with a simple, smart, and resilient solution.

# Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: Provide a lightweight, reliable, and AI-augmented task management system for small teams.

Objectives:

- Enable real-time collaboration with minimal setup
- Integrate AI models to suggest workload balancing and task prioritization

# Scope
In Scope:
- Core task CRUD operations
- Basic AI-driven task recommendations
- Web and mobile-friendly interfaces
Out of Scope (initially):
- Enterprise-level integrations (e.g., Jira, Slack)
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Highly granular role-based permissions

# Stakeholders
- End Users: Small distributed teams (3â€“15 people)
- Developers: Open-source contributors and maintainers

# Success Criteria
- AI-driven task suggestions reduce manual reassignments by 20%+
- Achieve 95%+ user satisfaction in usability testing

# High-Level Architecture
- Frontend: React 
- Backend: Java Spring Boot Spring Boot microservices
- Database: PostgreSQL (relational) + Redis (caching)
- Messaging: Kafka
- Auth: JWT-based authentication (Spring Security)
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
- AI Component: Python microservice for workload balancing

# Future Vision
In the long term, this project could evolve into a broader AI-driven collaboration suite with integrations into calendars, messaging apps, and predictive workload forecasting.
